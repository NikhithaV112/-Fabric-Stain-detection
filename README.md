🧵 Fabric Stain Detection
A Computer Vision project using AI/ML to detect stains on fabric images. This helps in quality control for textiles by automatically identifying stained or defective areas.

📌 Features
✅ Detects stains in fabric images

✅ Uses image processing + machine learning techniques

✅ Flask web interface 

✅ Works with batch image datasets

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV (image processing)

TensorFlow / Keras / Scikit-learn (ML/DL models)

Flask 

Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

🚀 How It Works
Collect fabric images (with and without stains).

Preprocess images (resize, grayscale, normalize).

Train an ML/DL model to classify/detect stained regions.

Run predictions on new fabric images.
